# TinyUI

Introducing TinyUI, your own component roster. This is the Tailwind CSS implementation of TinyUI Components. We have given each component a name, which you can find below the actual component on our website. You can copy the code from here and use it in your project. The components are designed to look good on all screens.

We will be adding more components as time flies, so be ready! ðŸ”¥

To get started, simply copy the code from the folder of your preferred component. For some components, we have used a style.css file instead of pure Tailwind CSS. We made this decision because we didn't want to make it difficult for users to customize the components. Since every project has a `global.css` or `style.css` file, we thought using a CSS stylesheet for certain parts would be better. We hope you like it!
